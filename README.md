## Bridge and Torch Problem – Animated Simulation

This project is a Python-based animated simulation of the classic **Bridge and Torch problem**, developed using the **Tkinter GUI framework**.  

The program visually demonstrates how a group of people with different crossing speeds can cross a bridge using a single torch while minimizing the total time required.

### 🔹 Key Features
- Interactive animated simulation using Tkinter
- Visual movement of characters across the bridge
- Real-time time calculation for each step
- Implements optimal strategy for minimum crossing time
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Clear display of steps and total crossing time

### 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter  
- Basic animation techniques  (Graphics) 
- Algorithm for optimal crossing strategy  

### 🔹 Objective
The main goal of this project is to help students easily understand the logic and strategy behind the Bridge and Torch problem by converting a theoretical puzzle into a visual and interactive simulation.

### 🔹 Use Case
This project is very useful for:
- Students learning algorithm design
- Visualizing classic problem-solving strategies
- Academic demonstrations using Python GUI

### 🔹 How to Run
1. Install Python (3.x recommended)
2. Run the program:
open command prompt
-> cd file location
-> python torchgraphics.py or app.py
